# AgroTech App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan and features for the AgroTech application. The goal is to build a modern and user-friendly Flutter application for the agricultural technology sector.

## Current State

The application is a basic Flutter app that successfully builds and runs on Android. It includes the `flutter_local_notifications` package, and the initial setup for Firebase is in place.

## Plan for a Visually Appealing and Modern UI

My next steps are to transform the default Flutter counter app into a visually stunning and modern application. I will focus on the following areas:

1.  **Theming:**
    *   Implement a Material 3 theme with a custom color scheme derived from a seed color.
    *   Integrate the `google_fonts` package to use custom, professional-looking fonts for typography.
    *   Create a theme provider to allow users to switch between light and dark modes.

2.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Redesign the main screen with a more engaging and visually balanced layout.
    *   Incorporate modern UI elements like cards with subtle drop shadows to create a sense of depth.
    *   Use a consistent and aesthetically pleasing color palette.

3.  **Code Quality and Structure:**
    *   Refactor the code to follow best practices for separation of concerns.
    *   Introduce the `provider` package for state management, starting with the theme provider.
    *   Ensure the code is clean, readable, and well-documented.

This initial phase will set the stage for adding more advanced features to the AgroTech app. I will start by implementing the theming and UI enhancements.
